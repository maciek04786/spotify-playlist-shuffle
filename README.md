For years I've been constantly annoyed by Spotify's playlist shuffle, I think it's awful, it just plays every other song,
there is nothing random about it, I just missed good old Winamp... Thankfuly, while learning Python I came across "spotipy" :)
This simple app takes the name of your Spotify playlist, gives it a proper shuffle and saves the new playlist with the same name.
I love it!
